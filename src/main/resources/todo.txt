Finishing item pipes:
    - Redo pipe.getOutlineShape(...)
    - Extractor pipes send items even if inventory is full. Items get deleted
    - Make sure extractor pipes don't see the source inventory as a valid destination
    - Fix render ids getting saved to the world. Produces visual glitches on world load
    - Add correct behavior when pipes are broken
    - Add correct behavior when pipes are unloaded from the world
    - Cleanup render id memory leak in pipe renderer
    - Change item pipes to iron instead of copper
    - Add item pipe recipe
    - Add item pipe drops, including what is in the pipe

Future:
    - Abstract pipes to not be item-specific
    - Add fluid pipes
    - Add energy pipes
    - Add filter pipes (diamond)
    - Add valve pipes (quartz)

Far future:
    - Steel ingot: Used for machines, made my smelting iron (consistent with Ad Astra)
    - Steam engine. Produces power from water and combustibles. Made of steel and copper
    - Combustion engine: Produces power from liquid fuel. Optional oxidizer increases efficiency
    - Electric heater for electric furnaces and ore processing
    - Ore processing system
    - Blunderbuss: A powerful, short range shotgun. Rounds made of any metal nugget
    - Pump
    - Quarry replacement
    - Fuel refinery: Makes fuel from oil, mead from honey, and ethanol from mead
    - Openblocks elevator replacement
    - Research system
